### Weather App

Our weather app leverages the power of the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to provide current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and extended daily forecasts for any location. Users can easily search for cities and receive up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

### Weather Extension

The weather extension brings the same real-time weather data directly to your browser. With a simple and clean interface, users can quickly check the weather without leaving their current webpage. This extension is designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, making it a convenient tool for daily use.
